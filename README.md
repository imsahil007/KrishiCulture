Features:
•	A one-click simple application to rent farming equipment.
•	The farmer can sign up using email or mobile verification
•	Targeting a farmers mobile as well as kiosks (android based using android device or emulators) that would be kept in multiple locations in the farmer's proximity. 
•	The farmers can then use this application to rent or hire tractors as well as farming equipment/mechanizations at a nominal amount. 
•	For more tech-savvy farmers there will be an option to display a list of rental agencies involved/registered in this program along with their contact details as well as the equipment cost. 
•	There is a speaker button on the bottom-right corner of the app which will read aloud the basic functionality of the screen that you opened in the regional language. You can select the language while registering for the app or whenever you feel so by accessing the settings. 
•	The user will be able to apply for loan through the app
•	Farmers can also access details about various government schemes for farmers
•	Future updates will also help in determining the climate
•	By registering with a payment gateway (to be done by app administrator), the user will be able to pay via the app for the rental. The user will also receive messages for the payment transactions by payment gateway. Note: This will be only implemented at the final phase of the project as payment gateway requires a lot of documents and some fees which will be paid by the organization itself. So, we won't add this feature right now.
